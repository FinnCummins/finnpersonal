title: My summer in Dogpatch labs

### At the moment I have been working out of Dogpatch labs in Dublin, Ireland.
During my summer break after my second year of computer science and business at Trinity College Dublin
I have decided to get back into free lance consulting and build up my customer base once again.
So far I have been working on a personal portfolio website to display my projects, a static 
website for one of my clients and a developer dashboard for one of my clients who is also based
here in Dogpatch.
