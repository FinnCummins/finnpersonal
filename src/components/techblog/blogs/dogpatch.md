### Dogpatch labs - Dublin, Ireland.
During my summer break after my second year of computer science and business at Trinity College Dublin
I have started doing free lance web development. So far I have been working on a personal portfolio website to display my projects, a static website for one of my clients and a developer dashboard for one of my clients who is also based here in Dogpatch.
